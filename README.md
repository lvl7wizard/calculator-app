# Casio SL-300SV

Welcome to my Casio SL-300SV calculator replica, this app was created using JavaScript and React. 
I created this project as a way of exploring the capabilities of CSS Grid for creating layouts and to practice working from pre-existing designs.
I have added basic functionalities for all buttons.

## Live Demo

A live version of the project is avaliable here [here](https://casio-sl-300sv.netlify.app/).
