# Casio SL-300SV

Welcome to my Casio SL-300SV calculator replica created using JavaScript and React. 
I created this project as a way of exploring the capabilities of CSS Grid for creating layouts and to practice working from pre-existing designs.
I have added basic functionalities for all buttons.
